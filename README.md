SAR Image Colorization
This project demonstrates SAR image colorization using TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch. It utilizes the SEN1-2 dataset, which contains paired SAR and optical images. The code builds, trains, and visualizes results from both TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch models. Please download the SEN1-2 dataset from here and set the dataset_path variable accordingly.
